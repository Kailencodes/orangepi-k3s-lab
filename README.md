# orangepi-k3s-lab
A comprehensive home-lab initiative to master modern orchestration tools. 'Project Zero' utilizes a single-node (scaling to multi-node) K3s cluster on Orange Pi hardware. The core objective is to eliminate manual configuration: using Ansible playbooks to bootstrap the OS and CI/CD pipelines to deploy Python-based network scanners.

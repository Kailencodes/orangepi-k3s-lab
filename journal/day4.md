# These Days are definitely not in order

## What I did today
- Installed the lightweight k3s so i can run containers 
- figured out how to see the index file off the nginx i set up.. using my ip and the running pod port number
- draft dashboard page for index.html
- added the python port scanner I created earlier to directory
## Challenges
- The image was only pulling amd64 so i edited the deployment file so images will read multiple architectures

## Next steps 
- create a good looking dashboard
- create more python network monitors
- send output of that data to json to display on dashboard
- configure worker py (maybe)

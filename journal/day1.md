# Day 1 - Hardware setup, OS, Git and Github
Today marks the first day working on the continous integration / continuous deployment
project. 

## In order of things completed today.
- Set up orange pi zero 3 1.5gb sbc with direct ethernet connection.
- Flashed debian for pi onto micro sd for operating system.
- used nmap -sn to find hosts on my network to find the new ip address (I could
not access my router to check it) 
- set static Ip addressing so the I can consistently ssh into orange pi
- set up basic password 
- Set up Git on orange pi using git config username and password as well as ssh gen keys.
- cloned the repo I made on github and tested first commits, created journal and playbooks folders.
- Installed btop to check temps and load on orange pi (btop is so cool)
